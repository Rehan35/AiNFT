# AiNFT
After using midjourney API to generate an image, I use Pinata as my IPFS service to store the image on a blockchain service. I then use the deploy nft script and mint nft to deploy the contract then mint the nft.

# How to run
**py main.py** (This will generate the url link for the midjourney image with the prompt you used to generate.)\
**py view-image.py** (Paste the url link into the view-image.py variable which takes the link and this script will display the image)

From here, you will have to use Pinata, or another ipfs service to store your image on a node in the blockchain.\
Once you do so, you can run the script to mint an nft.\

**node deploy.js** (This will run the script to deploy the contract. It will create an address for the token, Save this Adress for the mint script)\
**node mint-nft.js** (This will deploy the NFT to the ethereum blockchain. Right now, it will deploy to the Sepolia Testnet, but you can change the location of deployement in the code.)

# Updates
The next big step is to utilize the Pinata API reference and use their API to submit the link generated by the Python script and upload it to the ipfs chain.\
At this point the whole system will be automated.

# Notes
view-image.py and main.py allow Midjourney AI Art generation.
